Haha but seriously, this repo is... something. 

I wrote this code when I was about 3 weeks into web development and I barely understood CSS but I decided to dive headfirst into React because I needed to get this to work on time.

In other words, I had no idea what I was doing and if you go throught the commits, you'll see that it took me quite some time
to complete this project.

Eventually, I finally got it to work, but somehow the original code just vanished into thin air and all I had left was the
builds folder and some resources (This is the builds folder).

To this day, I have no idea what happened to the original code and I've been too lazy to refactor this one. Probably because it
might even be a better idea to start afresh.

To add, edit or remove articles, go to writing.html and search for "RAKEEM", it's pretty straightforward from there (and yes I 
know its horrible practice).

Safe to say its not my best work.
